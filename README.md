motd
====

So I wanted to add an interesting MOTD on my school computers that essentially pipes fortume to cowsay but I don't have sudo permission so I had to make my own. 


###Install Instructions 

To install this mord, clone the repo to your home directory. Then add 


```
~/.motd/motd
```


to one of your bash startup scritps. 

Enjoy! I hope you like it. 


####Credits

I used the following API. I should probably give credit. 

[iheartquotes API](http://iheartquotes.com/api)

I also give credit to jcn over at https://github.com/jcn/cowsay-py for his Python implementation of Cowsay! Thanks! 
(Note: I added grass to the cow, the rest is his.)
