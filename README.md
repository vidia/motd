So I wanted to add an interesting MOTD on my school computers that essentially pipes fortume to cowsay but I don't have sudo permission so I had to make my own. 


** Install Instructions 

To install this mord, clone the repo to your home directory. Then add 

````~/.motd/motd````

to one of your bash startup scritps. 

Enjoy! I hope you like it.
